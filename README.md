# itc-server


This is a version of the `basic-case` repo running with grackle


## TODO
 
- [ ] Setup deployment on heroku
- [ ] Integrate tracing with natchez
- [ ] Properly configure the itc endpoint

## Long term
Ideally we'd port the old ITC codebase and integrate it here. This is no small task but an initial
attempt was started on the `legacy-port` branch
