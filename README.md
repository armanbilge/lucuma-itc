# itc-server


This is a version of the `basic-case` repo running with grackle


## TODO
 
- [ ] Use values rather than buckets for cloud extinction and image quality
- [ ] Support CORS
- [ ] Require auth

## Long term
Ideally we'd port the old ITC codebase and integrate it here. This is no small task but an initial
attempt was started on the `legacy-port` branch
