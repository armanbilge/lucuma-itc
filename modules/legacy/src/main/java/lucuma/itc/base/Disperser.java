/**
 * Representation of a disperser element.
 * This defines the wavelength range for which the disperser lets light pass and also the dispersion and
 * resolution which is used by the slit visitor to calculate the signal and background strength.
 * For most dispersers the resolution is defined in nm for a 0.5-arcsec slit and the actual resolution
 * for the given slit width is then extrapolated from this value; note that the methods provided here also allow
 * to account for the case where the image quality is smaller than the slit; by default it uses the image quality
 * instead of the slit width to set the size of the resolution element in that case.
 * Some dispersers may need to implement a different behavior for how the resolution and dispersion are calculated
 * by overriding these methods, see e.g. the NIRI grisms (which don't use interpolation from the half arcsec slit
 * width) or GNIRS (which has to take a camera scale factor and the cross dispersion order into account).
