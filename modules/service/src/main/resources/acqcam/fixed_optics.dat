# transmission file for the acquisition camera fixed optics
# i.e. excludes filters and detector

# Design value is 0.76 and approximately independent of
# wavelength. 

# This has been divided by a factor of sqrt(2) to provide
# some performance margin: 21-Feb-2001 Phil Puxley 

# columns are (1) wavelength in nm (2) transmission
