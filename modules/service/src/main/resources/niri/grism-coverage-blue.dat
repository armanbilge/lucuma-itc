# This file contains the spectral coverage of the various (JHKLM)
# NIRI grisms with the BLUE OFFSET slit and f/6 camera

# Note that is there is no useful blue offset slit then the
# wavelength coverage given is the same as the default centre slit

# the columns are start wavelength, end wavelength, pixel width
# in spectral dimension (all in nm)
