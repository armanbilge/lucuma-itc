# Average throughput for the GNIRS static optics
# Columns are (1) wavelength in nm, (2) throughput
# Optical elements included: CaF2 window, Pickoff mirror, Entrance fold,
#  Offner Primary, Secondary and 2nd Primary, Cold Stop, Exit Fold and Collimator
# Values from J. Elias sensitivity table with zeroes added at 700 and 6000 nm.

# 30 Sept 03, BR: renamed file; divided values by sqrt(2) fudge factor
#
# 30 Jan 04; applied another 20% supression to bring overall ITC into
# agreement with measurements. Total supression is now 1.2*sqrt(2) = 1.70
