# Average throughput for the GNIRS Short Blue camera
# Columns are (1) wavelength in nm, (2) throughput
# Values from J. Elias sensitivity table with zeroes added at 700 and 6000 nm.
# Table seperates Long vs Short camera at each lambda; here
#  I have used only the Orders 3-6 values for the blue camera (and assumed 0 beyond K)
