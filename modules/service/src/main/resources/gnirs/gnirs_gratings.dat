# All 3 gratings are blazed for 6.8um (1st order Lithrow) which
# gives an effective 1st order blaze wavelength of 6.6 (with 27deg 
# scattering angle).  Resolutions given in Users manual are lam/dlam
# for 2 pixels, with gratings operated at blaze peak.  This corresponds
# to 0.3arcsec slit with short camera; R and d_lam have been adjusted
# to 0.5arcsec slit (3.33 pix); nm/pix is unchanged.  d_lambda is for blaze
# wavelength.
#
# Values are for short camera; multiply by 3 for the long camera.
