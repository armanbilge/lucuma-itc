#Read Noise
#This has yet to be measured with the real Michelle science-grade array.
#This is the approximate value for the detector's deep-well mode.
#The moderate-well mode read noise should be about 1/2 this value.
4000
#Dark Current per pixel per second
#Don't know, wild guess.  Dark Current usually isn't a factor
#with these devices.
